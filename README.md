### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Apache Clickjacking Protection Errors.
---

Apache Clickjacking Protection Errors refer to a security vulnerability in the Apache web server that allows an attacker to trick a user into clicking on a malicious link or button, leading to unintended actions or data theft. Clickjacking is a common attack technique used to exploit user interface design flaws and bypass web application security measures. The protection errors indicate that the web server is not properly configured to prevent clickjacking attacks, leaving it susceptible to exploitation. It is important to address this vulnerability quickly to prevent potential data breaches or other security incidents.

### Parameters
```shell
export PATH_TO_APACHE_CONFIG="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_APACHE_ACCESS_LOG="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_APACHE_ERROR_LOG="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check Apache version
```shell
httpd -v
```

### Check Apache configuration for "X-Frame-Options" header
```shell
grep -i "x-frame-options" ${PATH_TO_APACHE_CONFIG}
```

### Check Apache configuration for "Content-Security-Policy" header
```shell
grep -i "content-security-policy" ${PATH_TO_APACHE_CONFIG}
```

### Check Apache access logs for clickjacking attempts
```shell
grep -i "clickjacking" ${PATH_TO_APACHE_ACCESS_LOG}
```

### Check Apache error logs for any relevant errors or warnings
```shell
tail -n 50 ${PATH_TO_APACHE_ERROR_LOG}
```

## Repair

### Configure the web server to send X-Frame-Options headers to prevent clickjacking attacks. This can be done by adding the following line to the Apache configuration file: "Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN".
```shell
bash

#!/bin/bash

APACHE_CONF="/etc/apache2/apache2.conf"

X_FRAME_OPTS="Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN"



# Check if Apache config file exists

if [ ! -f $APACHE_CONF ]; then

    echo "Error: Apache config file not found at $APACHE_CONF"

    exit 1

fi



# Check if X-Frame-Options are already set

if grep -q "X-Frame-Options" $APACHE_CONF; then

    echo "X-Frame-Options are already set in $APACHE_CONF"

    exit 0

fi



# Add X-Frame-Options to Apache config file

echo $X_FRAME_OPTS >> $APACHE_CONF



# Restart Apache server to apply changes

systemctl restart apache2


```
